<p><strong>You are being asked to participate in a research study.</strong> You are not required to participate in this study. This document contains important information about this study and what to expect if you decide to participate. Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether or not to participate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this form is to provide you information that may affect your decision to join this research study. The person presenting the research will describe the study to you and answer all of your questions. Please read the information below and ask any questions you might have before deciding whether or not to give your permission to join.&nbsp; If you decide to be involved in this study, this form will be used to record your permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong><u>Purpose</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">The study will last 12 months. You are NOT required to participate in the research. The goal of the research is to study the impact of DBIP on housing, employment, finances, health, and relationships.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Research will include the following activities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color:black;">Long surveys at the start of DBIP, 6 months, and 12 months (3 surveys total). Long surveys should take 45-60 minutes to complete, and you will be paid $30 for each survey.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:black;">Monthly text surveys (12 short-form surveys total). Text surveys should take 10-15 minutes to complete, and you will be paid $10 for each completed survey.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:black;">Some people will be asked to do in-depth interviews at 3 months and 12 months (two interviews total). Interviews should take 60-75 minutes to complete, and you will be paid $40 for each interview.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;">You may choose not to join the study. If you choose to join, you can stop participating in the study at any time, and it will not affect your status in the DBIP program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong><u>Risks or Discomforts</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:white;color:black;">Possible risks of being part of this study may include stress or discomfort. Additionally, the risk of&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">harassment, threats, and other forms of negative treatment may come with receiving cash payments. Severe cases of reported self-harm, harm to others, harassment, threats, mental or emotional distress, or substance abuse that show up in any of the research activities will result in contact from our team.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:white;color:black;">If we learn that you intend to harm yourself or others, including, but not limited to child or elder abuse, suicidal thoughts, or threats against others, we must report that to the authorities as required by law.&nbsp;Additionally, you may be required to leave the study, should risks related to your participation be too high.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Study participation also carries the risk of loss of privacy or confidentiality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong><u>Benefits</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">The main possible benefit from this study is helping inform the community about the impact of direct cash for unhoused people residing in Denver. We cannot and do not promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. Your decision to participate in this study will not affect services you receive from participating organizations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><u>Source of Funding</u></strong></p>
<p>The Center for Housing and Homelessness Research at the University of Denver is receiving financial support from Impact Charitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Confidentiality of Information</u></strong></p>
<p>All of the information you provide will be confidential.&nbsp;Your name will not be used in any report, and your data will be reported in a way that will not identify you. Your responses will be assigned a unique ID. The list connecting your name to this code will be kept in a secure file. We are the only ones who will have access to the file. When the study is completed and the data have been analyzed, all identifiable data will be destroyed within five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Limits to Confidentiality</u></strong></p>
<p>The information that you provide in the study will be kept confident. However, if we learn that you have intentions to harm yourself or others, including, but not limited to child or elder abuse, suicidal thoughts, or threats against others, we must report that to the authorities as required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, there may be circumstances where this information must be legally shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review of this study takes place, reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the data you provide may be collected and used by <span style="color:black;">AidKit<i>,&nbsp;</i></span>per its privacy agreement. This research is only for U.S. residents over the age of 18. Please be mindful to respond in private and through a secured Internet connection for your privacy. Your confidentiality will be maintained to the degree permitted by the technology used. Specifically, no guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the Internet by any third parties.</p>
<p>Information collected about you will not be used or shared for future research studies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Certification of Confidentiality&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>Participation in research may cause a loss of privacy. In this study, you will be asked about <span style="color:black;">alcohol and drug use. The researchers will keep information confidential, when possible, but complete confidentiality cannot be&nbsp;</span>promised. In some situations, research records have been required by a court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. This helps us protect your privacy. The Certificate means that we do not have to give out identifying information about you even if we are asked to by a court of law.&nbsp; We will use the Certificate to resist any demands for identifying information.</p>
<p>We cannot use the Certificate to withhold your research information if you give your written consent to give it to an employer or some other person.&nbsp; Also, you or a member of your family can share information about yourself or your part in this research if you wish.</p>
<p>There are some limits to this protection. We will voluntarily give information to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A member of the federal government who needs it in order to evaluate the research;</li>
    <li>Individuals at the University of Denver, the funding agency, and other groups involved in the research, if they need the information to make sure the research is being done correctly;</li>
    <li>The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), if required by the FDA;</li>
    <li>Child Protective Services, Adult Protective Services, or 911 if we learn of child abuse, elder abuse, or the intent to harm yourself or others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Data Sharing</u></strong></p>
<p>De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information (e.g., your name, date of birth) that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information or samples we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.</p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong><u>Incentives to Participate</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Study participants will be compensated for completion of the following research activities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color:black;">Long surveys: You will be paid $30 for each long survey.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:black;">Monthly text surveys: You will be paid $10 for each text survey.&nbsp;</span></li>
