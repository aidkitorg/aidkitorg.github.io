We will contact you though the contact information you provided to us on your application (email or phone).

This helps make sure you get all of the cash assistance you are supposed to.</p>
    <p><b>Trusted Secondary Contact</b></p>

    <p><b>Termination</b></p>
    <p>This program is designed to support the well-being of child care providers and the families they care for. As such, we have the right to terminate your enrollment in this program. Specifically, your participation may be terminated for the following reasons:</p>

    <h2>THRIVING PROVIDERS PROJECT PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>Congratulations on being a part of The Thriving Providers Project! You will be given a monthly cash payment because we know the work you do caring for children is important. It is our goal to support the economic well-being of family, friend, and neighbor child care providers</p>
    <h3>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p><b>Payment Amount: </b>You will receive $250 every two weeks, for a total of $500 per month.</p>
    <p><b>Payment Duration: </b>You will receive 18 months of payments.</p>
    <p><b>Payment Method: </b>You have two options for how you'd like to receive payments:
    <ul>
            <li><b>Option 1: Direct Bank Deposit: </b>
                <p>Payments will be sent through a direct bank deposit (ACH transfer) to the participant's bank account. The participant has to have an active bank account in the United States to select this method.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Option 2: Debit Card: </b>
                <p>The program will provide the applicant with a USIO debit card. The program will load the payments to the participant's debit card. The participant does NOT need a bank account to receive payments using this method.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Payment Frequency: </b>You will receive $250 at the beginning of the month and $250 in the middle of the month. The exact dates for when you will receive your payments is dependent on which payment method you chose.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Direct Bank Deposit: </b>
                <p>All monthly cash assistance payments will be sent on the 12th & 28th of the month, and will likely hit the participants bank account around the 1st and 15th of the month. Please note, given direct bank deposits can take 2-3 days, we cannot predict exactly when the recipient will receive the payments.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Debit Card: </b>
                <p>All monthly cash assistance payments will be loaded onto the participants debit card on the 1st and 15th of the month.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Peer Support Groups</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>You will be given the option to join a peer support group. This group will meet weekly. If you choose to join, you will be placed in a group with other providers in your area. The weekly meetings will be led by a trained clinician with experience providing mental health services. In the meeting, you can discuss a variety of topics (i.e. how to support children with mental health, emotional, and social development, or how to deal with stress, burnout, anxiety or other needs). In the meetings, you will also learn about upcoming trainings, events, or other resources that may be helpful to you. Groups will be offered in Spanish or English, depending on what language you prefer. 
    <br/>
    <br/>These peer support groups will take place via Zoom (on smartphone, tablet or computer) or by phone (if internet is not available). You do not have to attend every weekly meeting.
    <br/>
    <br/>This is an optional activity and not required by participants in the Thriving Providers Project.</p>
    <p><b>Resource Referral & Navigation</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>If you are also interested in learning about resources in your area can also be connected with a Peer Navigator. Peer Navigators will help you find locally available resources in their community, like professional development opportunities, food banks, local library events, and more.
    <br/>
    <br/>If you choose, you will be added to a WhatsApp, SMS, or Facebook group to receive updates, connect with other providers, and ask for support in finding resources.
    <br/>
    <br/>This is an optional activity and not required by participants in the Thriving Providers Project.</p>
    <h3>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</h3>
    <p>This program is intended for family, friends, and neighbor child care providers currently caring for children that are not your own. While you are now approved and enrolled in the program, we will need to have your eligibility reverified every six months. During this reverification, we will verify whether: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You still caring for at least one non-custodial, non-biological child, and</li>
        <li>You are caring for less than four children at any given time or less than two children under two at any time (unless you have a child care license or are caring for a single family).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To verify, we will contact you every six months using the contact information you provided on your application.</p>
    <p>If we cannot get in touch with you, or you are no longer eligible, you will have 90 days to meet the re-verification requirements or the cash payments will end. We understand that in some cases, the families you provided child care services to at the start of the program move or no longer require services. In this case, you will need to find a new family to care for in order to remain enrolled in the program within 90 days of the reverification period.</p>
    <h3>PUBLIC BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>It important that you understand you run the risk of experiencing a loss or decrease in public benefits (i.e. SNAP, WIC, etc.), given the monthly cash payment associated with participating in this program. Upon enrolling, you will receive education around your benefits to help you understand the potential impacts of program involvement on cash and non-cash benefits. We can help provide resources and support to understand the risks, as needed. You, however, are responsible for ensuring you understand the impact and are comfortable with joining the program prior to signing the Thriving Providers Project agreement form.</p>
    <h3>COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
    <p><b>Can I change how I'd like to receive payments?</b><p>Yes, you can change the payment method or bank account at any time during the program period.  To do so, contact  the Community Based Organization (CBO) whom  enrolled you (contact information below).</p></p>
    <p><b>I have a new phone number or my contact information changed. What should I do?</b><p>If you would like to change your contact information, you must notify the Community Based Organization (CBO) that enrolled you. Your phone number will be used to re verify your eligibility. To continue to receive  payments, we must be able to get ahold of you so please keep us up to date as your contact information changes.</p></p>
    <p><b>How do I activate my USIO debit card?</b><p>You can activate your card by calling the number on the sticker on the card. This is easy - they will ask you to set your PIN number once activate. Don't share this PIN number with anyone!</p></p>
    <p><b>How do I find my balance on my USIO debit card?</b><p>You can find your balance by calling USIO at 1-855-925-4626. You can also create an online account at <a href="https://www.akimbocard.com/incentive/">Akimbo Card</a> and see your balance anytime through the online portal. The community-based organization that enrolled you will not be able to tell you your balance.</p></p>
    <p><b>How do I get a new USIO debit card if I lost mine or it was stolen?</b><p>If a card is lost or stolen, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Report the card as lost/stolen to the USIO customer support team as soon as possible by calling 1-855-925-4626</li>
            <li>The USIO customer support team can mail you a card (this takes up to 30 days) or you can contact the community-based organization that enrolled you to get a new debit card issued and activated after the card has been reported as stolen.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Can I get reimbursed for the money that was used off my stolen USIO debit card?</b><p>The program will only load the amount equal to the remaining balance from the old card onto your new card. If there are any funds that were stolen/used before the card is reported stolen to USIO, the applicant will need to dispute charges directly with USIO  by calling 1-855-925-4626</p></p>
    <p><b>Where can I use my USIO debit card?</b><p>You can use your card anywhere that accepts Mastercard as well as any ATM. It works just like a normal debit card would.</p></p>
    <p><b>Can I use an ATM to withdraw cash using my USIO debit card?</b><p>Yes. You can use an ATM to withdraw cash using your card. You can find a list of ATMs at <a href="https://www.allpointnetwork.com/">All Point Network</a>. If you use these ATMs, you will be charged a $2 fee. If you use another ATM, you will be charged a $2 fee plus any other fees company may charge for using their ATM (usually $2-$5).  However, if you select the 'Cash Back' option when you are checking out at a supermarket and paying with your debit card, you won't be charged any fee to withdraw cash! This is the cheapest and best option. To do this, just use your debit card when you buy groceries and when checking out, select the option to 'Get Cash Back' or inform the cashier you want cash back.</p></p>
    <p><b>Will I have to pay taxes on this income?</b><p>No. This income is a gift[1] as defined by the IRS and is therefore not taxable income. As such, you do not need to claim it as income for your tax returns.</p></p>
    <p>[1] A gift is a designation by the IRS. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/102">26 USC §102 (Gifts and Inheritance)</a>; IRS Rev. Rul. 99-44 <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb99-44.pdf">(Gifts and Charitable Contributions)</a>. If an individual receives a gift, they qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion, meaning the income is non-taxable income.</p>
