    <h3>OTHER PROGRAM TERMS</h3>
    <p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
    <p>All of the information you provide will be kept confidential and stored in an encrypted, secure data-base. Your name will not be used in any report, and any program data reports will be reported in a way that will not identify you.</p>
    <p><b>No Risk of Public Charge</b></p>
    <p>There is no public charge risk applying for or participating in this program.</p>
    <p><b>Confirmation & Pause of Payments</b></p>
    <p>We will do our best to make sure that all cash payments are reaching you in full. Therefore, on a periodic basis, the Thriving Providers Project may reach out to you to confirm you are receiving the cash payments. We will contact you though the contact information you provided to us on your application (email or phone). If we cannot reach you, the Thriving Providers Project reserves the right to pause payments to make sure they are not being sent to an incorrect recipient. If we pause payments, all payments will be delivered once we get in touch with you and confirm you have been receiving the payments. After this confirmation, the pause will be lifted. This helps make sure you get all of the cash assistance you are supposed to.</p>
    <p><b>Trusted Secondary Contact</b></p>
    <p>If the Thriving Providers Project is unable to communicate with you through the contact information you provided in your application, we will reach out to a secondary contact to try to get in touch.</p>
    <p>Name: <b>{{ secondary_name }}</b></p>
    <p>Phone: <b>{{ secondary_phone }}</b></p>
    <p>Email: <b>{{ secondary_email }}</b></p>

    <p><b>Termination</b></p>
    <p>This program is designed to support the well-being of child care providers and the families they care for. As such, we have the right to terminate your enrollment in this program. Specifically, your participation may be terminated for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you no longer meet the eligibility requirements during re-verification (every 6 months)</li>
        <li>If you voluntarily withdraw from the program (see below);</li>
        <li>If you knowingly misrepresent your identity or eligibility to project staff;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Termination from the program means you will no longer have access to the monthly cash payments. You will be notified in writing by the Thriving Providers Project if your participation is terminated.</p>
    <p>Additionally, if you choose to be paid by prepaid debit card (see below for more information on the payment options) and you do not activate your card within thirty (30) days of receiving it, the Thriving Providers Project can cancel the payment and terminate you from the program to provide other providers the opportunity to join. We will attempt to contact you using the contact information you provided at least one time prior to cancelling the payment, and will inform the community-based organization who enrolled you to support you in activating the prepaid debit card if you need assistance.</p>
    <p><b>Voluntary Withdraw</b></p>
    <p>You may choose to withdraw from at any time by notifying the Thriving Providers Project in writing.

    <p><b>Research Participation</b></p>
    <p>All program participants are encouraged to participate in Stanford University's RAPID-EC research study, which will help create evidence to support more FFN providers with direct cash assistance, but have the right to refuse participation in any of the research activities.</p>
    <p><b>Benefits Impact</b></p>
    <p>The public assistance you currently receive or intend to apply for  (i.e. SNAP, SSI, etc.) while enrolled in this program may be impacted by receiving these funds. By signing this form, you are stating that you are aware of the potential risk that receiving direct cash may impact your eligibility for public benefits.
